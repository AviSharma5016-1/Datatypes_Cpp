# C++ Program: Data Types and Their Sizes


## ‚úÖ Aim:

To write a C++ program that takes input of various data types (int, float, string, double, char, and bool), displays their values, and prints their memory size in bytes using the `sizeof()` operator.

---

## üìö Theory:

C++ supports multiple built-in data types, each occupying different amounts of memory based on the system architecture (commonly 4 or 8 bytes). The `sizeof()` operator in C++ returns the number of bytes used to store a data type or variable.

In this program, we:

* Use `cin` to take input of different types: integer, float, string, double, character, and boolean.
* Use `cout` to display both the value and size of each input.
* Learn how string objects differ from primitive data types in size due to their internal structure.
* Understand how memory usage may vary across data types but is consistent on a single system.

This program reinforces the concept of **data types**, **input/output**, and **memory management basics** in C++.

## üìù Conclusion:

The program was successfully executed. It helped understand how various data types are stored in memory and how to use the `sizeof()` operator to determine their sizes. It also gave practical experience in handling input/output operations for multiple data types. This is an essential foundation for working with variables and memory in larger C++ applications.
